## Introduction

I often find myself in need of an implementation of Hindley-Milner to experiment
with, so I wrote this library as a template implementation of a Hindley-Milner
like language. Only Algorithm W is currently implemented. The library isn't
meant to be used as a dependency for other projects, but rather as a starting
point.
